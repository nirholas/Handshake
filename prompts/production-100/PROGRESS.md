# production-100 progress log

The only memory between chats for this pack. Append, never rewrite. Newest at the bottom.

Format:

```
## <date>: <order name, or "map">
Measured: <the numbers you read, with the command>
Did: <what shipped, with commit SHAs>
Left: <exactly what remains, who owns it, and which follow-up file or OWNER-ACTIONS row carries it>
```

Orders run from other packs log in THEIR pack's `PROGRESS.md`; this file carries only this
pack's four orders, ship-readiness runs, and map-level changes (rows added to
[OWNER-ACTIONS.md](OWNER-ACTIONS.md), orders retired from [00-INDEX.md](00-INDEX.md)).

## 2026-08-09: pack created

Measured: production at `c1e600a04` (2026-08-07 build) vs `main` at `e5ad85478`;
`/event` and `/event.json` 404 on the live site with the event window configured for
2026-08-09 17:00 UTC; the dry-run reclaim path in `api/_lib/economy-sweepback.js` still
returns its plan before key recovery; `/play/war` vite input now exists (that gap closed
since the event preflight noted it, so no order was written for it).

Did: authored the map (00-INDEX), the four pack orders (01 ship readiness, 02 stranded
wallets, 03 master key hygiene, 04 mixed verdicts), OWNER-ACTIONS with 13 rows, and the
event closeout order in the event pack. Existing packs were indexed, not duplicated: every
open order there was already sized for a single agent chat.

Left: everything; the map is the queue. The most time-critical row is OWNER-ACTIONS row 1
(the deploy) with the event window hours away.
