# Roadmap build: Phase 1: reconstruction capacity for 10k avatars/day

How to run: paste this file's repo path into a fresh Claude Code chat in this
repository and say "run this work order". This file is fully self-contained:
it depends on no other prompt file anywhere. If neighboring files in
prompts/swarm-100/ are gone, that work is done; if present, ignore them.
Every claim below rots; step 0 re-measures, and what you measure wins.

## Operating clause (binding)

- Read CLAUDE.md first. Its rules override everything, including this file.
- Finish 100% in this session. Never end the turn with a question, an option
  list, or an unexecuted plan. A judgment call goes in one line of the final
  report; it never becomes a question that halts work.
- The only permitted stops are the CLAUDE.md stop-and-ask gates: spending real
  funds or any irreversible on-chain write, git push or a production deploy,
  committing content that references a crypto project other than $THREE, and
  destroying unrecoverable data.
- No mocks, no fake data, no placeholder stubs, no unfinished-work markers, no
  commented-out code. Real APIs and real integrations only.
- The em-dash and en-dash characters are banned in everything you write.
- Concurrent agents share this worktree: stage explicit paths only (never a
  bare add-everything), and commit finished work promptly.
- Before committing, run: npm run check:rules -- --paths <files you touched>.
  It must exit 0.

## Context

This order builds one roadmap slice from the README Roadmap (the canonical
phase plan). It is independent of every other roadmap order: if adjacent
slices are absent, build to this slice's boundary with clean interfaces and
never block on them. Solana leads on every chain decision; EVM legs ship
behind flags and never stall the Solana path.

## Task

Roadmap sizing: GPU inference sized to 10k avatars/day at launch. Turn that
from a sentence into measured, configured capacity.

Step 0: read docs/ops/gcp-credits-plan.md (fleet, quota, pre-approved
scaling) and the reconstruction worker's service config; measure current
throughput with a small real load run (5 concurrent jobs) and record
per-job latency and cost.

Build: autoscaling configuration for the reconstruction lane that reaches
10k/day within the pre-approved credit plan (config-only Cloud Run updates
are pre-approved), a load test script under scripts/ that proves sustained
throughput at a derated target, and a capacity note in docs/ops/ recording
measured numbers. File quota increases immediately if a limit blocks the
target, then route around them while they process.

Documentation is part of the feature, not a follow-up: update the docs layer
that applies (data/pages.json for a new page, README for a new directory,
docs/ for a developer capability, specs/ for a wire format) and append a
holder-readable entry to data/changelog.json for anything user-visible.

## Definition of done

- [ ] Measured baseline and post-change throughput numbers in the report,
      from real runs.
- [ ] Autoscaling config applied (config-only updates are pre-approved) and
      verified live.
- [ ] Load test script committed under scripts/ and runnable; docs/ops note
      updated.
- [ ] check:rules clean on touched files.
- [ ] Docs and changelog layers updated per the CLAUDE.md documentation
      rules; npm run audit:docs clean if docs changed.
- [ ] git diff reviewed line by line before claiming completion.

## Never blocked

| Blocker | Resolution (act, do not ask) |
|---|---|
| Missing env var or credential | Check .env and .env.local, then the Cloud Run service env, then Secret Manager (the CLAUDE.md self-unblock playbook has the exact commands). If it truly exists nowhere, wire the code fully behind the env var, prove the wiring with a dry run, and name the single missing var in the report. |
| gcloud not on PATH | Run: export PATH="$HOME/google-cloud-sdk/bin:$PATH" |
| Dev server port 3000 busy | Another agent may be serving this repo; probe it and reuse if so. Otherwise start your own on a free port: npx vite --port 3101 |
| Playwright browser missing | npx playwright install chromium |
| A surface needs a signed-in user | Register a fresh account through the real /register flow against the real API and use it. Never mock the session. |
| A defect sits in code you did not touch | Fix it if it blocks a Definition of done line (root cause it, never mask it). Otherwise note it in the report and continue. |
| An unrelated test is red | Same rule. Never pipe npm test through tail; it masks exit codes. |

## Close out (required)

1. Verify every Definition of done line with the actual command output in
   front of you. Never claim a line you did not verify.
2. Commit with explicit paths and a subject that describes the diff (house
   style: type(scope): what changed and why a reader cares).
3. Delete this prompt file in that same commit:

       git rm prompts/swarm-100/roadmap-p1-throughput-capacity.md

   The shrinking directory is this campaign's only progress ledger; there is
   no progress log to update.
4. Final report: what step 0 measured, what changed (file list), evidence per
   Definition of done line, and any one-line judgment calls. No trailing
   questions, no unexecuted plans.

If a line genuinely cannot pass inside this session (an external party must
respond, or an owner-gated action is the final step), finish everything else,
leave this file in place, and state exactly which line remains and who owns
it. Never delete this file on a partial.
