# x402 Buildout Plan

Comprehensive plan to wire every use case documented in [x402-foundation/x402](https://github.com/x402-foundation/x402) into this codebase, end-to-end, professionally, with no mocks.

## Source material

- v2 spec: `specs/x402-specification-v2.md`
- Transports (v2): `specs/transports-v2/{http,mcp,a2a}.md`
- Schemes: `specs/schemes/{exact,upto,batch-settlement,auth-capture}/`
- Extensions: `specs/extensions/`
- Developer docs: `docs/` (Mintlify source for docs.x402.org)
- Project ideas: `PROJECT-IDEAS.md`

Local clone of source: `/tmp/x402-docs/`.

## Conventions across every prompt

Every prompt assumes the operating rules in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md):

- No mocks, fake data, placeholders, TODOs, or stubs.
- Real APIs only. Real network calls. Real signatures. Real on-chain settlement on configured networks.
- UI work must be exercised in a real browser. Server work must be exercised with `curl` or a real client.
- Push to BOTH `origin` and `threews` after merges.
- Use real env vars from `.env` (or `vercel env`). If a secret is missing, surface it once and stop — never invent.

Each prompt ends with an **Acceptance** checklist. A use case is not done until every box is ticked.

| 40 | [unstoppable-agent.md](prompts/40-unstoppable-agent.md) | Self-funding agent provisioning its own infra |

## Cross-cutting touchpoints

These ship with every paid endpoint:

- `vercel.json` — register the route (existing `functions` wildcard covers `api/**/*.js`, but well-known paths and custom rewrites must be added).
- `.env.example` — every new env var documented.
- `public/x402.js` — UI surface for client-side flows.
- `api/_lib/x402.js` — shared helpers (already exists; extend, don't fork).
- `data/archives/` and `data/rss/` — discovery and feed integrations where relevant.

## How to execute

Each prompt is self-contained. To pick one up:

1. Read the prompt fully.
2. Read every linked spec/doc.
3. Build only what the prompt asks for. Do not invent surrounding scope.
4. Wire it through the full stack (server, client, UI if relevant, env, vercel.json).
5. Run the dev server. Exercise the path. Capture the result in the Acceptance checklist.
6. Commit. Push to BOTH remotes.

## Status tracking

Track progress by editing the checkboxes in each prompt's **Acceptance** section. Roll up status here when finishing a phase.

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| 1 Foundation | **done** — x402-spec.js, facilitator client |
| 2 Sellers | **done** — paidEndpoint helper with exact EVM, exact SVM, direct BSC |
| 3 Buyers | **done** — x402-buyer-fetch.js, x402-buyer-axios.js |
| 4 Transports | **done** — MCP server in mcp-server/, a2a via auth-hints |
| 5 Extensions | **done** — bazaar discovery, payment identifiers, sign-in-with-x, offer-receipt, gas-sponsoring, builder-code, auth-hints |
| 6 Hooks & Ops | **done** — spending limits, access control/api-key bypass, audit logging, idempotency cache, paywall UI in public/x402.js |
| 7 Productized agents | **partial** — fact-checker, pump-agent-audit, and tutor (USE-33, per-call settlement) exist; wealth-manager, prediction-oracle, kyc-checker, bounty-hunter, consultant-booking, crypto-shopper, bounty-poster, weather-donations not started |
